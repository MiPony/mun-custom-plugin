                - <b>There are many variables that must be considered to give our customers the best service at the most competitive price.</b>
                We have factored all variables and have concluded that this is the best way to accomplish this.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <b>We send notices via mail and email 3 months early to begin routing each technicianâ€™s day.</b>
                This is why it is so important to respond as soon as you receive our correspondence.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <b>The route is being built in real time and many changes occur during these 3 months. These changes will not effect your test date.</b>
                This is why we ask for a generic time frame of 7am - 4pm, so there are as many options as possible in filling up the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <b>Due to the nature of change, we must avoid specific times in order to stay efficient.</b>
                Customers reschedule frequently and if the route is now permanent, it is no longer flexible, therefore wasting fuel and time. 
                Of course, we can accommodate special situations, but we ask you for the biggest time frame and understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <b>The day before and the day of your appointment, you will be emailed 
                a 3-hour time window of your technician's ETA, estimated time of arrival.</b>
                This is why confirming your email after scheduling is imperative, so you're up-to-date 
                with your reminders and the emails don't end up in the spam folder.

            <p>
                - <b>The day of your appointment, your technician's day is set and cannot be altered.</b>
                Please be considerate to all the other people before and 
                after your appointment to help us keep the 3-hour window as small as possible.
